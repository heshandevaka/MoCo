# MoCo-ICLR2023
This repository contains the codebase used to generate the main results of [Mitigating Gradient Bias in Multi-objective Learning: A Provably Convergent Stochastic Approach](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=dLAYGdKTi2), which has been accepted to ICLR 2023. This codebase is an extension to/ modification of [Conflict-Averse Gradient Descent for Multitask Learning (CAGrad)](https://github.com/Cranial-XIX/CAGrad) and [LibMTL](https://github.com/median-research-group/LibMTL/tree/main) codebases.

For running multi-task-supervised learning tasks (NYUv2 and Cityscapes datasets), follow the instructions in `CAGrad/REAME.md`.

For running multi-task-supervised learning tasks (Office-31 and Office-home datasets), follow the instructions in `LibMTL/examples/office/REAME.md`.
